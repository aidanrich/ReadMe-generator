# ReadMe-generator
## Description
- We were tasked with creating a node based app that would generate a README.md file by taking user input through a terminal instance.
- By using this generator you can easily make sure your README covers the most common items included in a good readme.
- This project helped us learn about Template Literals, Node js and the inquirer package.

## Installation
- You will need to use 'npm init' and 'npm i inquirer' in a command line while in the index.js file.
- This will give you access to the package needed to run this app.
## Usage
- In the terminal instance use the 'node index.js' command. You will then be given prompts to answer. When finished a README-gen.md file will be created in your directory for your use.
